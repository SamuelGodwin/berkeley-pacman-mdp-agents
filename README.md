The files that I wrote in exclusively is [mdpAgents.py]; the rest of the materials are from Berkeley's Cs188x AI course (so I claim no credit for them) and Simon Parsons.

Python ver 2.7.

To run, download the files and move to the directory where the base files are in, and run python pacman.py -p MDPAgent -l mediumClassic, where mediumClassic is the map Pacman's playing on.

Run with graphics off with flag --- to run (considerably) faster. Run with flag ... to get an idea of overall win rates: All tests were ran 10 times iteratively using 
-n 10. 

-h for commands

-q, --quietTextGraphics for graphics off - generate minimal output and no graphics

-t, --textGraphics   Display output as text only

This, CW1 of this module and one other module (was it the scala ones? iai..) had the yowza that's a lot of files limit when uploading via upload (too many files in the test_cases folder so couldn't include that folder). If this were done via git command line push, it would upload without the limit no problem!
